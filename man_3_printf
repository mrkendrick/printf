.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "main.h"

int _printf(const char *
.I format
.B , ...)
.SH DESCRIPTION
_printf is a function that prints to the standard output under the control of a
.I format
string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed, excluding the null byte used to end output to strings.

If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
.SH Conversion Specifiers
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.BR c
The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, then the resulting character is written
.TP
.B s
The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to a terminating null byte, but do not include the terminating null byte.
.TP
.B d, i
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.TP
.B x, X
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned lowercase hexadecimal notation(x), or unsigned uppercase hexadecimal notation(X).
.TP
.B u
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned decimal notation
.TP
.B o, b
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal notation(o) or binary notation(b).
.TP
.B p
Address is printed in hexadecimal.
